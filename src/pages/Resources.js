            </a>, a downloadable workbook for kids in grades 2-5 and their adults. This booklet will encourage children to 
            develop an awareness for all of nature and to appreciate it as a gift from God. The activities, stories, and prayers will help them to take joy often, even daily, in creation. 
            From that awareness, this resource then strives to encourage a childâ€™s curiosity about the natural world, and subsequently, a concern for it. 
            These aspirations are all interwoven with an attitude of joy and thankfulness for a loving God. Written by parishioner Anne Neuberger. 
            A black-and-white version will be available in August.
